 multiple-inheritance.js
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yet another suicidal module for multiple inheritance for JavaScript. If you
have a good idea which applies multiple inheritance, it is usually an
inidication of a disastar; don't use this module unless you are one of those
programmers who has no afraid of programmatic death like kamikaze programmer.
